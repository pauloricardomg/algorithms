Algorithms and data structures implemented by Paulo Ricardo Motta Gomes (github.com/pauloricardomg).

Most of the implementations in this project are based on lectures from the Coursera course "Algorithms, Part I" 
of Princeton University (https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI) and its reference textbook "Algorithms, 4th 
Edition by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne".
